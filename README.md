# FacePulse: Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System

FacePulse is an AI-driven facial recognition-based attendance system developed using Python, Streamlit, and OpenCV. This system allows users to register with their ID and name, captures their images via webcam, trains a machine learning model to recognize faces, and tracks attendance in real-time. 

## Features
 
- **User Registration**: Capture images through webcam and associate them with a user ID and name.
  
- **Model Training**: Train a facial recognition model on the captured images.
  
- **Real-Time Attendance**: Detect and track attendance using the trained model.
  
- **Streamlit User Interface (UI)**: Easy-to-use web interface for registration, model training, and attendance tracking.
  

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for the application.
  
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web interface.
  
- **OpenCV**: For image capture and processing.
  
- **Pyngrok**: For tunneling the local application to the web.
  
- **Facial Recognition Libraries**: For identifying and verifying registered faces.
