## FacePulse: Facial Recognition-Based Attendance System 

FacePulse is an AI-driven facial recognition-based attendance system developed using Python language, Streamlit application, and OpenCV. This system allows users to register with their ID and name, capture their images via webcam, train a machine learning model to recognise faces, and track attendance in real time.  

## Features 
 
- **User Registration**: Capture images through webcam and associate them with a user ID and name.
   
- **Model Training**: Train a facial recognition model on the captured images. 
   
- **Real-Time Attendance**: Detect and track attendance using the trained model.
  
- **Streamlit User Interface (UI)**: Easy-to-use web interface for registration, model training, and attendance tracking. 
  

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for the application.
  
- **Streamlit**: This is for building the interactive web interface.
  
- **OpenCV**: For image capture and processing.
  
- **Pyngrok**: For tunnelling the local application to the web.
  
- **Facial Recognition Libraries**: These are for identifying and verifying registered faces.
